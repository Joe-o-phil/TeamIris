HOW TO USE THE BOT

The bot can be interacted with in two ways.

    By using a slash command: in any channel call /save-conversation and the bot will reply with a conversation saved response. This command creates a slack.json file that holds the conversation history.

    By real time interaction: interact with the bot in real time by typing @iris help it will respond with to save a conversation type /save-conversation.
